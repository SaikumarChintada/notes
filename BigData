BigData:


A pipeline to store event data in Parquet
Data was being accessed via Hive


MYNOTE. :CAP, LeaderELection .. - complete cassandra



CAP:

database cannot guarantee consistency, availability, and partition-tolerance at the same time

make a tradeoff between availability and consistency (as P is important in most cases)
Managing this tradeoff is a central focus of the NoSQL movement


Consistency: writes and future reads are conistent

maintaining eventual consistency in the application layer is too heavy of a burden for developers.


The complexity caused by the CAP theorem is a symptom of fundamental problems in how we approach building data systems
- isolate its complexity
- mutable state in databases
  use of incremental algorithms to update that state
- 

Concepts : Data applications range from storing and retrieving objects, joins, aggregations, stream processing, continuous computation, machine learning, ....
Solutions: RDBMS's, indexing, OLAP, OLTP, MapReduce, ETL, distributed filesystems, stream processors, NoSQL.......


immutable data -> easy replication impl.
